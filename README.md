# Hello There

French student here! I like Elixir and Phoenix and I really want to work with data intensive projects (and maybe AI ?) :)

## Working on...

- A discord bot for my classmates and I
- My porfolio
- An article about Phoenix 1.6 aimed at beginners

## In the future...

- A bit of cybersecurity would be nice
- Some Rust (or Go? or both?)
- Machine learning maybe

## Some stats because we all love stats
